<h3>Who am I?</h3>
I am a passionate <b>Full Stack web developer</b> with a love for logic and functions. Although I may sometimes seem like an enemy of styles, my main focus is on delivering solid and efficient technical solutions for businesses. I strive to present projects with scalable, readable, and well-organized code, providing a strong foundation for future improvements and maintenance.

<h3>Where am I heading?</h3>
I strongly believe in reciprocity and seek to offer to companies what I would like to receive as a developer. This involves clear and open communication, effective teamwork, and a results-oriented approach. I strive to establish collaborative relationships based on trust and transparency.
Challenges are my motivation, and I am always looking to explore new technologies. Even though I may sometimes complain about them, I enjoy the satisfaction of acquiring new tools through practice, which allows me to optimize my code and stay updated in such a dynamic field as web development.

<h3>What technologies do I use?</h3>
The Henry bootcamp has allowed me to acquire the fundamental knowledge and experience to take off. Some of the main technologies I handle include:

<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>Express.Js</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Sequelize</li>
<li>GIT</li>
</ul>
among other tools. I also have knowledge in <b>GraphQL, Apollo, MongoDB, Bootstrap</b>.
